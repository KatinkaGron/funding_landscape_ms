Year: 2024	Grantee: Maastricht University Medical Center+	Amount: DKK 400,000	"The Symposium on Epidermal Differentiation Disorders (EDD) aims to expand the network of experts within EDD by involving and stimulating the future generations of researchers, clinicians, patient organizations, and industry. Organized by leading EDD experts, the event will bring together these stakeholders from diverse backgrounds to brainstorm, promote collaborative research, and design new trials.
EDD are a group of rare hereditary skin conditions characterized by skin thickening, scaling, and redness caused by pathogenic variants in the involved genes. EDD, which include ichthyosis and palmoplantar keratoderma, may affect only skin and related structures (hair, nails) or also other tissues in syndromic subtypes (for example, the brain, heart, hair or eyes). No cure is available, and treatments are limited and not effective enough. Because EDD can severely affect quality of life, the unmet need is high, and an improved understanding of its basis will make it easier to develop treatments that target the causes of disease.
The two-day symposium – currently scheduled for 15-16 September 2025 near Paris, France – will review updates on classification of EDD, clinical and genetic discoveries, novel targeted treatments, patient perspectives, and research. In addition to scientific sessions, the symposium emphasizes collaboration and networking opportunities. Panel discussions and a dedicated session for young researchers will encourage knowledge exchange and exploration of innovative approaches.

Year: 2024	Grantee: Ole Pedersen, Chief physician , Professor, Zealand University Hospital, Køge	Amount: DKK 2,715,598	"Ole Pedersen’s project aims to determine the genetic basis of rosacea and the causal connection between rosacea and its comorbidities.
Rosacea is a common chronic inflammatory skin disease of the face, which may manifest as a bulbous nose, central erythema, flushing, inflammatory papules/pustules, or broken vessels in addition to diverse eye involvement. Severe rosacea has a large impact on the patients’ quality of life, social and psychological well-being and has been linked to many systemic comorbidities including cardiovascular, psychiatric, neurological, and cancer diseases.
Ole Pedersen’s project aims to identify the genetic pathways of rosacea and determine the causal connection and modifiable risk factors to previously reported systemic comorbidities. He has recently developed a rosacea classification tool and applied it to a deep phenotyped cohort of ~55,000 Danes allowing for detailed analysis of association between rosacea, risk factors and co-morbidities. In addition, Ole Pedersen has facilitated genotyping of 500,000 Danes that can be used for genome wide association study meta-analysis with other genetic cohorts from Iceland, Finland, UK and USA to perform the so far largest genetic study on rosacea. Based on this analysis, his project will determine the genetic correlations and perform Mendelian randomization analysis of the causation between rosacea and comorbidities.
Ole Pedersen’s project may provide new understanding of disease pathogenesis and the link to systemic comorbidities, paving the way for developing new treatments and early targeted interventions."

Year: 2024	Grantee: Xiaoyang Wu, Associate Professor, University of Chicago	Amount: DKK 4,000,000	"Xiaoyang Wu’s project aims to engineer self-amplifying RNA vector as a platform for gene therapy of recessive X-linked ichthyosis, with potential for treatment of other skin diseases.
Skin ichthyoses are a group of heterogeneous genetic diseases that are characterized by hyperkeratosis, localized or generalized scaling, and often associated with xerosis, hypohidrosis, erythroderma, and recurrent infections. So far, mutations in more than 50 genes have been shown to cause ichthyosis, which affect a variety of different cellular processes, ranging from DNA repair, lipid biosynthesis, cell adhesion, and skin differentiation. Recessive X-linked ichthyosis (RXLI) is the second most common form of inherited ichthyosis. RXLI is caused by mutations in the STS gene on the X chromosome, which encodes microsomal steroid sulfatase. The skin abnormalities of RXLI are caused by the impact of excess cholesterol sulfate, which affects lipid synthesis, organization of the lamellar lipids that provides the skin permeability barrier, corneodesmosome proteolysis, and epidermal differentiation.
As a genetic disorder, RXLI is a life-long condition that can significantly affect domestic life and cause psychological problems for the patients. More effective treatment beyond current symptomatic management is urgently needed. Xiaoyang Wu’s project will explore the possibility that engineered self-amplifying RNA vector can serve as a novel platform for gene therapy of RXLI.
Xiaoyang Wu’s project may serve as proof-of-concept for a novel paradigm for the treatment of patients with genetic skin disorders."	Grant category: Research Grants in open competition	Geography: USA	Development of novel RNA replicon vectors for treatment of skin genetic disorders
Year: 2024	Grantee: Rebecca Deprez-Poulain, Professor, Institut Pasteur de Lille	Amount: DKK 3,190,714	"Rebecca Deprez-Poulain’s project aims to investigate the therapeutic potential of ERAP1 and ERAP2 inhibitors for the treatment of psoriasis.
Psoriasis is caused by the erroneous recognition by T-cells of the immune system of self-peptides called antigens presented at the cell surface by the HLA-C receptor. This results in destruction cells and subsequent chronic inflammation. ERAP enzymes, which are the main actors of antigen preparation within cells, influence the immune response, and genetic studies show that several ERAP variants predispose to psoriasis. Rebecca Deprez-Poulain has identified selective inhibitors of ERAP1 and ERAP2 which decrease antigen presentation and T-cell activation and show preliminary positive results in vivo. Her project will combine structural biology, medicinal chemistry, biochemistry, and cellular biology to optimize current compounds into potent and selective inhibitors targeting ERAP. It will assess their therapeutic potential in purposely designed transgenic mouse models containing human ERAP, as well as in patient cells.
Rebecca Deprez-Poulain’s project may define the optimal profile of an ERAP inhibitor as a pharmacological tool, providing a foundation for the exploration of ERAP roles and eventually an ERAP-based oral treatment for psoriasis."

Year: 2024	Grantee: Christoph Schlapbach, Associate Professor, Inselspital, Bern University Hospital, University of Bern	Amount: DKK 3,942,000	"Christoph Schlapbach’s project aims to elucidate the role of interleukin (IL-)18 in atopic dermatitis (AD), a prevalent, chronic skin disease with significant burden and unmet therapeutic needs.
IL-18 is linked to AD pathogenesis by multiple lines of evidence: IL-18 receptor (IL-18R) gene variants associate with AD susceptibility, IL-18 levels correlate with disease severity, and animal models of AD suggest a pro-inflammatory function of IL-18 in type 2 skin inflammation. Yet, the functional link between IL-18, considered a Th1-promoting cytokine, and AD, a Th2-driven disease, remains obscure. Christoph Schlapbach’s preliminary data now indicate that (i) there is a functional link between AD-associated IL18R gene variants and heightened Th2-cell responses, (ii) IL-18 can promote secretion of pathogenic cytokines in Th2 cells of AD patients, and (iii) skin explants from lesional AD skin can be used to model the effects of IL-18 in the complex environment of human skin.
Christoph Sclapbach’s project will leverage genotype-phenotype-function studies in a translational approach to dissect the mechanisms by which IL-18 influences Th2 cell-mediated inflammation in AD. Utilizing state-of-the-art methodology and functional validation experiments, the study aims to clarify IL-18’s role in AD pathogenesis to answer this long-standing conundrum in the fields of dermatology and immunology.
The results of Christoph Schlapbach’s project may provide a new understanding of IL-18’s role in AD, potentially enabling improved treatment."

Year: 2024	Grantee: Jeffrey Rasmussen, Assistant Professor, University of Washington	Amount: DKK 3,834,520	"Jeffrey Rasmussen’s project investigates the mechanisms governing Langerhans cells’ immune response in wound healing, particularly the role of the microtubule cytoskeleton.
Skin provides a robust and durable physical barrier essential for regulating hydration and repelling pathogens. Damage to skin must be rapidly resolved to maintain organ homeostasis. Epidermal-resident immune cells known as Langerhans cells use dendritic protrusions to dynamically surveil the skin microenvironment, which contains epithelial keratinocytes and somatosensory peripheral axons.
The mechanisms governing Langerhans cell dendrite dynamics and responses to tissue damage are not well understood. Jeffrey Rasmussen and his lab have developed a tractable system using adult zebrafish to study Langerhans cell dynamics. Initial studies using this system revealed several new discoveries, including: 1) that Langerhans cells are the primary phagocyte for degenerating somatosensory axons; 2) Langerhans cells undergo stereotyped responses to local and tissue-scale keratinocyte wounds; and 3) the actin regulator ROCK regulates key aspects of Langerhans cell wound responses. Despite advances in identifying mechanisms of actin function in Langerhans cells, roles for the microtubule cytoskeleton in Langerhans cell biology remain essentially unknown. In preliminary studies, Jeffrey Rasmussen has developed a novel transgenic reporter for microtubules in Langerhans cells and found that the microtubule cytoskeleton dynamically reorganizes during wound responses. His project aims to determine how the microtubule cytoskeleton contributes to the intracellular trafficking and dynamic wound responses of Langerhans cells.
The results of Jeffrey Rasmussen’s project could lead to new fundamental understandings of Langerhans cell biology and dynamics."	Grant category: Research Grants in open competition	Geography: USA	Control of Langerhans cell dynamics and function by the microtubule cytoskeleton
Year: 2024	Grantee: Maria Alcolea, Associate Professor, University of Cambridge	Amount: DKK 3,887,952	"Maria Alcolea’s project explores how the plasticity of skin cells is affected by aging. Maria Alcolea and her team will study the molecular pathways that modulate changes in cell behaviour throughout life. The ultimate aim is to identify new targets to improve tissue regeneration and delay the regenerative decline associated with human skin ageing.
The ability of epithelial cells to rewire their program of cell fate in response to tissue perturbations has emerged as a new paradigm in stem cell biology. This plasticity improves the efficiency of tissue repair by enabling differentiated/lineage committed cells to reacquire stem cell-like behavior in response to damage. However, despite obvious implications for skin regeneration, virtually nothing is known about how the plastic capacity of skin cells is affected by ageing, and whether this contributes to changes in the normal physiology of the epidermis at later stages in life.
Maria Alcolea’s project will investigate the impact of aging in skin cell fate plasticity by making use of a novel in vivo model that enables tracing the fate of epidermal cells from the earliest stages of commitment towards differentiation. Newly developed tools offers a unique opportunity to identify the mechanisms dictating epithelial cell fate plasticity and determine whether aged-associated changes in this process hold the key to understand why the regenerative capacity of our skin declines over time. She will combine the lab’s expertise in in vivo quantitative lineage tracing, single-cell RNA sequencing approaches, and mathematical network analysis. Observations made in in vivo mouse models will be compared to human skin using a novel 3D organ culture.
Maria Alcolea’s project may contribute significantly to the emerging field of epidermal cell plasticity and provide a benchmark for identifying potential targets to partially reduce/reverse skin ageing."

Year: 2024	Grantee: Sophia Maschalidi, Assistant Professor, Universiteit Gent	Amount: DKK 3,986,871	"Sophia Maschalidi’s project explores the significance of enhancing efferocytosis – clearance of apoptotic cells by phagocytes – in skin injury repair, with the overall aim of accelerating wound closure.
The continual turnover of billions of cells in our bodies occurs as professional and non-professional phagocytes engulf cells dying via apoptosis. The efficiency of cell clearance or efferocytosis is remarkable and critical for homeostasis, minimizing inflammation and promoting repair. As the largest organ in our body, the skin acts as our first line of defense. Tissue repair after skin injury involves the clearance of apoptotic cells by phagocytes at the wound site as part of the process of resolving the inflammation and restoring the barrier. The importance of hastening barrier restoration is highlighted in chronic non-healing wounds, such as those associated with diabetes or in excess healing reactions after wounding leading to pathological scar tissue formation or fibrosis.
Sophia Maschalidi’s project aims to develop appropriate tools to enhance efferocytosis in vivo. Using novel techniques and sophisticated genetic mouse models, it will systematically address, for the first time, the importance of boosting efferocytosis during primary skin injury repair and in subsequent challenges. It will address how primary phagocytic experience shapes long-term changes on phagocytes and neighboring cells and whether this “efferocytic memory” shapes responses to secondary assaults.
Sophia Maschalidi’s project hopes to result in a fundamental understanding of the mechanisms and potential in boosting efferocytosis for therapeutic benefit in cutaneous wound management."

Year: 2024	Grantee: Yossi Buganim, Associate Professor, The Hebrew University of Jerusalem	Amount: DKK 3,996,300	"Yossi Buganim’s project investigates the mechanisms behind fibroblast dysfunction in aging skin and develops a novel technology for rejuvenating aged fibroblast to improve wound healing.
Fibroblasts are pivotal in orchestrating skin wound healing processes, contributing to fibrin clot breakdown, extracellular matrix synthesis, collagen formation, and wound contraction. These multifaceted roles highlight their significance in skin repair following injuries, which trigger a cascade of synchronized healing mechanisms. Despite their crucial functions, aging impairs fibroblast functionality, leading to prolonged and impaired wound healing processes, increasing susceptibility to chronic wounds and scarring. Elderly individuals experience delayed wound healing, partly attributed to reduced cell division of the aged fibroblasts and diminished fat cell production and attraction to the wound area, resulting in thinning skin and heightened vulnerability to injuries. Moreover, aging cells exhibit slower regeneration, compromised bacterial defense mechanisms, and increased inflammation, further hindering the healing process.
Addressing these age-related impairments is imperative for advancing wound care strategies. Yossi Bunganim’s project seeks to elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying fibroblast dysfunction in aging and leverage novel partial reprogramming technology to rejuvenate aged fibroblasts, enhancing wound healing outcomes.
Yossi Bunganim’s project aims to develop innovative interventions to mitigate the burden of chronic wounds and scarring in the aging population, ultimately improving overall quality of life and healthcare outcomes."

Year: 2024	Grantee: Nicolas Manel, Research Director, Institute Curie	Amount: DKK 2,723,700	"Nicolas Manel’s project explores the mechanisms of skin aging and immunity dysfunction, with a focus on establishing a novel model for investigating the role of the nuclear envelope in skin aging.
Genome instability is considered a central mechanism of aging. The nuclear envelope is essential for genome stability. Nicolas Manel’s laboratory recently reported that in mice deficient for a protein of the nuclear envelope in the immune system, alveolar macrophages, but not other lung immune cells, acquire aging hallmarks and decline in number, as observed in chronological aging. This established that deficiency of a nuclear envelope component can represent a cell-intrinsic model of accelerated aging in specific immune cell types. In preliminary results, further explorations revealed that subsets of skin immune cells are also decreased in a mouse model of nuclear envelope deficiency. Interestingly, the same skin immune cells are decreased in the aged skin of humans and mice. Nicolas Manel’s project will test the hypothesis that loss of nuclear envelope integrity is a mechanism of aging in these skin immune cells. It aims to define the mechanisms leading to skin immune cell depletion, the impact on the immune cell homeostasis in the skin, and the pathophysiological consequences of such depletion in skin immunity against age-related pathologies.
The results of the project have the potential to reveal new fundamental pathways in the aging of skin immunity and its impact on the health of aged individuals."	Grant category: Research Grants in open competition	Geography: France	A novel model to study aging of skin immunity
Year: 2024	Grantee: Eran Elinav, Head of Department, Weizmann Institute of Science	Amount: DKK 4,000,000	"Eran Elinav’s project explores the role of circadian rhythm in regulating host-microbiome interactions in the skin, and the impact of abnormal circadian rhythm on the microbiota of the gut, with a potential link to skin inflammation, psoriasis in particular.
While the exact cause of psoriasis remains elusive, it is believed to stem from a combination of genetic and environmental factors, including dietary and biological clock-related influences. The mechanism by which these factors impact psoriasis is closely tied to the circadian rhythm, as evidenced by the abnormal circadian rhythms observed in psoriasis patients. In recent years, the pivotal role of the microbiota – the trillions of indigenous microorganisms inhabiting the human body – has come to the forefront. Eran Elinav’s group has recently uncovered that circadian disruption can exacerbate inflammatory diseases by disrupting the diurnal oscillations of the gut microbiota. His project explores how the circadian clock may also orchestrate fluctuations in the dermal microbiome, which could be crucial in understanding skin diseases such as psoriasis.

Year: 2024	Grantee: Lukas Sommer, Professor, University of Zurich	Amount: DKK 3,781,580	"Lukas Sommer’s project explores the mechanisms mediating the role of repair glia in skin wound healing by means of genetically engineered mouse models and an organotypic 3D culture system of human skin wounds.
Inefficient skin wound healing can cause severe medical problems, including chronic wounds and ulcers. Innervation is a critical player in tissue regeneration and repair. While most studies have linked this effect to signaling from axons, there is increasing evidence for peripheral glia contributing to successful wound healing. Lukas Sommer’s laboratory has recently shown that peripheral glia following skin injury to become repair glia, which promote the wound healing process by paracrine signaling. In his project, single cell RNA sequencing on the cellular microenvironment in presence or absence of repair glia at defined timepoints after skin injury will be performed and complemented with spatial omics approaches to characterize the gene expression profile of repair glia and to identify their mode of intercellular communications with other skin cell types. Multiplex optical imaging approaches on biopsies of murine and human skin lesions will allow the investigation of the relevance of our findings in human skin diseases. Finally, functional validation of key candidate factors in mice and in 3D reconstituted human skin wounds will determine how repair glia promote the wound healing process and which signaling pathways could potentially represent targets for treatment.
Lukas Sommer’s project therefore aims to enhance our understanding of wound healing mechanisms with potential broad applications in medicine."	Grant category: Research Grants in open competition	Geography: Switzerland	Repair Glia: An Overlooked Cell Type Orchestrating Skin Wound Healing

Modern biologic drugs have transformed the way we treat many diseases. However, these drug molecules are too large to pass biologic barriers and therefore need to be injected. For skin diseases, the outermost skin layer effectively prevents larger molecules from entering the skin.
To address this problem, Niclas Roxhed and his team have tailor-made ultra-sharp spiked microspheres that painlessly penetrate only the outermost skin layer and allow delivery of large molecules into skin. In this project, they will use these spiked microspheres in an atopic dermatitis model to topically deliver large-molecular nucleic acids and nanocarriers to inhibit inflammatory reactions. To verify effective delivery, Niclas Roxhed and his team will quantify inflammatory markers in skin using micro-sampling and proteomics profiling.

Year: 2024	Grantee: Rosaria Gandini, Assistant Professor, Aarhus University	Amount: DKK 3,462,144	"Rosaria Gandini’s project investigates the molecular details of the IgE-FceRI complex and its functioning on mast cells and basophils in order to improve treatment opportunities for urticaria.
Urticaria, a common inflammatory skin disorder characterized by itchy wheals, angioedema, or both, manifests in acute (AU) and chronic (CU) forms. It significantly impairs patients’ quality of life, causing sleep disturbances due to pruritus, fatigue, and anxiety. The symptoms arise from the activation of skin mast cells and basophils, leading to the release of histamine and other inflammatory mediators. This activation is initiated by cross-linking and clustering of the complexes between immunoglobulin E (IgE) and its high-affinity receptor, FceRI, which is expressed on the surface of these cells.
The FceRI-IgE complex hence acts as a powerful molecular switch, which initiates the inflammatory cascade and thus provides an attractive target for drug intervention. The structural basis of this activity, however, remains open.
Rosaria Gandini’s project aims to determine the structure of the FceRI-IgE membrane complex using state of the art Cryo Electron Microscopy (cryo-EM).
Successful elucidation of the molecular details of the entire complex and its conformations will allow identification of specific regions on FceRI for targeted intervention. This knowledge will deepen the understanding of the interaction of antibodies with Fc receptors in general and may pave the way for the development of specific and effective treatment of urticaria and related disorders."

Year: 2024	Grantee: Jakob Wikstrom, Associate Professor, Karolinska Institutet	Amount: DKK 4,302,900	"Jakob Wikstrom’s project aims to improve the understanding of mitophagy, a process where damaged and aged mitochondria are removed and recycled intracellularly, in relation to wound healing.
In the event of abnormal wound healing, chronic wounds may form and thereby place a large burden on healthcare systems. Importantly, treatment options remain limited owing to the complex nature of chronic wound pathogenesis, meaning alternative avenues need to be explored in the quest to develop novel therapies.
One avenue that Jakob Wikstrom and his team aim to pursue is that of targeting mitochondria and in particular, the quality-control process of mitophagy. Mitochondria play vital roles required for efficient wound healing, most notably in regulating metabolism. However, the role of mitophagy in wound healing is poorly understood, and only a few studies have studied it in human tissue.
Interestingly, preliminary data from human tissue and primary human cell culture for this project shows that mitophagy plays an important role in the early- and mid-wound healing stages, and that mitophagy induction aids in fibroblast and keratinocyte migration. However, the precise mechanisms of how mitophagy is required in these cell types during wound healing is yet to be elucidated.
Jakob Wikstrom and his team aim to evaluate the mechanistic role of mitophagy in wound healing through a variety of experiments on relevant human cell types, investigating metabolism, chronic inflammation, and gene expression, as well as comprehensively disseminating the impact of mitophagy on wound healing in mouse models.
Successful implementation of this project could provide novel ideas for and facilitate the development of future mitochondria-targeted wound treatments."	Grant category: Research Grants in open competition	Geography: Sweden	Deciphering the cellular and molecular role of mitophagy in wound healing
Year: 2024	Grantee: Brian Capell, Assistant Professor, University of Pennsylvania	Amount: DKK 2,885,457	"Brian Capell’s project seeks to better understand how epigenetic changes (modifications that do not change the sequence of genomic DNA) regulate the development of sebaceous glands.
Dysfunction of sebaceous glands (SGs) has been linked to a variety of common skin disorders ranging from atopic dermatitis to acne, sebaceous hyperplasia, seborrheic dermatitis and sebaceous tumors.
Brian Capell and his team have recently discovered that through genetic modification of the epigenome, they could promote a dramatic increase in the number and size of SGs (Ko, et al. Developmental Cell. In press. 2024). This surprising result demonstrated the direct role that epigenetics and chromatin organization plays in controlling SG development and abundance. It also suggested that targeting the epigenome might offer new ways to treat disorders characterized by aberrant SG development and activity.
Diseases related to aberrant SG development or activity can have a deleterious effect on both human physical and mental health. Despite this, very little is known of the role of epigenetics in SG development and homeostasis. To address this, Brian Capell’s project aims to test the influence of epigenomic modifiers and modifications upon SG development and disease to further dissect their contribution to the pathogenesis of these very common conditions.
Collectively, this project will address outstanding questions regarding the role of the epigenome in SG development and homeostasis and in common diseases driven by SG dysfunction – diseases that are both understudied and in need of better therapies."

Year: 2024	Grantee: Ataman Sendoel, Assistant Professor, University of Zurich	Amount: DKK 3,979,800	"Ataman Sendoel’s project seeks to improve our understanding of how genes are translated to protein during wound healing and clarify the potential of the involved pathways as drug targets.
Impaired wound healing poses a substantial medical challenge, particularly among the elderly. Understanding the gene expression changes during wound repair is therefore essential for devising new strategies to enhance wound healing in aging and disease.
While transcriptional (i.e., going from DNA to messenger-RNA) control has been extensively studied in the skin, recent studies have indicated that cellular behavior is strongly coupled to the regulation of translation (i.e., going from messenger-RNA to protein). However, how translation is controlled during wound repair and how its deregulation mechanistically contributes to impaired wound repair in aging remains unknown.
In this project, Ataman Sendoel and his team will exploit an in vivo strategy to comprehensively map the function of the translational landscape in skin wound healing. Leveraging a single-cell ribosome (an intracellular protein complex that translates messenger-RNA to protein) profiling strategy in vivo, the team will monitor skin cells during different wound healing stages. By coupling this with single-cell RNA sequencing, they will determine cell-type-specific translational efficiencies and identify factors relevant to wound repair in aging.
Finally, Ataman Sendoel and his team aim to carry out a mini-screen to identify FDA-approved drugs that selectively increase the translational efficiency of skin wound repair factors.
Collectively, these data will provide systematic insights into the translational landscape of skin wound repair, and how deregulated translation leads to impaired wound repair. It may also clarify if protein synthesis pathways could be targeted therapeutically to restore wound healing."

Year: 2024	Grantee: Rasmus Hartmann-Petersen, Professor, University of Copenhagen	Amount: DKK 2,600,678	"Rasmus Hartmann-Petersen’s project aims to characterize all possible missense variants (changes in genes which introduce a different amino acid in the resulting protein) in human keratins and investigate the importance of these variants in associated diseases.
Keratins are intermediate filament proteins that form a cytoskeletal network within cells. They are expressed in a tissue-specific fashion and form heterodimers, which then further oligomerize into filaments. Variants in several keratin encoding genes are linked to a range of hereditary disorders, including several epidermal skin diseases. On the molecular level, some pathogenic keratin variants appear to cause aggregation of the keratins.
In Rasmus Hartmann-Petersen’s project it is hypothesized that most keratin-disorders are protein misfolding diseases, i.e. diseases where the underlying genetic variants cause misfolding of the encoding protein. Rasmus and his team aim to explore this hypothesis by using computational tools, including large language models (a specific form of AI). They will test the validity of the computational predictions through focused cellular studies on selected keratins and identify components regulating keratin turnover.
The results will highlight the underlying molecular mechanisms for keratin-linked human disorders and provide predictions on the severity of all possible (both known and yet unobserved) coding variants in human keratin genes. The results could be of diagnostic value, but may also highlight the cellular protein folding and protein quality control machinery as potential therapeutic targets."

Year: 2024	Grantee: Eva Kummer, Associate Professor, Copenhagen University	Amount: DKK 4,902,307	"Eva Kummer’s project targets to improve our understanding of the replication machinery of the skin-infecting herpes simplex virus (HSV) in order to improve and expand treatment opportunities.
HSV is one of the most widespread viral infections. The virus persists lifelong in the nerve system of the host and causes recurrent infections with mild to severe symptoms.
Since decades, treatment of herpes infections has exclusively targeted the viral replicative DNA polymerase (an enzyme that copies the viral DNA) using nucleoside analogs. However, resistance to current nucleoside analogs is emerging necessitating the search for alternative targets.
A major caveat in developing anti-herpetic compounds is a lack of structural information of other components of the herpes simplex replication system, which are likely strong candidates for targeted drug development. Eva Kummer and her team will use cryo-electron microscopy to visualize the architecture and working principles of the protein complexes that drive herpes simplex replication. They will also aim to clarify how novel anti-herpetic drugs block the viral replication machinery and why naturally occurring resistance mutations inhibit their action.
Overall, the project will generate structural and functional insights of the HSV replication strategy and potentially improve and accelerate anti-viral drug design."

Year: 2024	Grantee: Georg Stary, Associate Professor, Medical University of Vienna	Amount: DKK 3,996,806	"Georg Stary’s project aims to investigate interactions between T cells and structural cells, including keratinocytes, in the skin and how this cellular communication may affect the function of the T cells in dermatological diseases.
Human skin is protected by specialized T cells, called tissue-resident memory T cells (TRMs), which are needed to protect against infection at the site of pathogen encounter, but can also mediate inflammation in certain conditions. The exact regulation of TRMs in human skin is not well understood, hence TRM-targeted therapies are currently unavailable.
Georg Stary and his team have discovered that T cells communicate with structural cells of the skin via certain surface molecules and acquire a TRM phenotype after interaction with keratinocytes and fibroblasts. Some of the newly described molecules that instruct T cells to become TRM have not been implicated in the regulation of T cell tissue residency before.
Georg and his team aim to explore how structural cells of the skin instruct the maintenance of human TRM, and how this cellular crosstalk changes during inflammation. Based on preliminary data, they will unravel the function of certain co-receptors in TRM regulation using modern single-cell sequencing technologies on primary tissue from patients and ex-vivo co-culture systems with genetically engineered human cells. Based on this, they will subsequently test the therapeutic potential of targeting T cell-structural cell interactions in a humanized mouse model of TRM-mediated skin inflammation.
This study will not only inform about new mechanisms of human TRM instruction in health and disease and explore options for developing clinical applications targeting interactions with structural cells, but also form the basis for designing clinical studies to treat selected TRM-mediated diseases, such as graft-versus-host disease or psoriasis."

Year: 2024	Grantee: Eliza Pei-Suen Tsou, Assistant Professor, University of Michigan	Amount: DKK 3,990,092	"The goal of Eliza Pei-Suen Tsou’s project is to understand the importance of aging endothelial cells (a cell type lining blood vessels) in scleroderma.
Scleroderma is an autoimmune disease characterized by inflammation, scarring of tissues and organs, including the skin, and changes in blood vessels throughout the body.
Most patients experience vascular abnormalities as one of the first symptoms, which trigger tissue stiffness and related complications later in the disease. Although these vascular changes are early critical events, the underlying cause of why they occur has not been determined.
Eliza Pei-Suen Tsou and her team found that dermal endothelial cells from scleroderma patients function differently compared to healthy controls. In particular, these cells undergo senescence, which is a process by which a cell ages but does not die off when it should. Over time, large numbers of senescent cells build up in the body. These cells remain active and release harmful substances that may cause inflammation and damage to nearby healthy cells.
In this project, Eliza and the team aim to determine the cause for vascular abnormalities in scleroderma, with a specific focus on how senescence is involved. They hypothesize that endothelial cell senescence is fundamental in causing the disease and might be targeted for therapy. Specifically, they propose that endothelial senescence accounts for the abnormality of endothelial cells in scleroderma, resulting not only in blood vessel changes but also in tissue scarring.
The goal is to determine why the endothelial cells acquire the senescent phenotype, and what this senescent phenotype does to promote the disease.
This project may form the basis for novel approaches to treating scleroderma."	Grant category: Research Grants in open competition	Geography: USA	Endothelial senescence in the pathogenesis of systemic sclerosis
Year: 2024	Grantee: Christopher Bunick, Associate Professor, Yale University	Amount: DKK 4,165,955	"Christopher Bunick’s project aims to improve and substantiate our current knowledge of the structure and function of Janus kinases (JAKs) to improve safety and efficacy when developing new JAK inhibitors.
Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitors are small molecule drugs that treat inflammatory dermatological conditions by inhibiting cytokine signaling. Currently targeted diseases include atopic dermatitis, psoriasis, hand eczema, alopecia areata, vitiligo, and hidradenitis suppurativa.
Optimal JAK inhibitor matching to dermatologic disease remains challenging because of cross reactivity among four related JAK kinases: JAK1, JAK2, JAK3 and TYK2. Each possesses catalytic kinase (JH1) and allosteric (JH2) domains (an allosteric domain is a site where binding of a molecule indirectly modulates the function of the protein, here the catalytic activity). Both JH1 and JH2 domains have been targeted for drug development, yet a scientific knowledge gap exists as to how the allosteric JH2 domain regulates catalytic JH1 function and the subsequent downstream activation of signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) proteins.
A barrier for JAK inhibitor prescription is its promiscuity; it may target more than one JAK, leading to broader cytokine suppression than desired. This poor selectivity is likely rooted in suboptimal drug discovery procedures emphasizing inhibitory capacity over selectivity, resulting in unexpected real-world side effects, including malignancy, cardiovascular events, and thrombosis.
Christopher Bunick and his team will use AI-based generative modeling, molecular dynamics, computational biophysics, structural biology, and biochemistry to (i) determine how JH2 allosterically regulates JH1; (ii) define the structural basis for enhancing selectivity against specific JAK domains; (iii) elucidate downstream mechanisms regulating STAT signaling; and (iv) elucidate molecular properties of JAKs beyond JH1/JH2 domains.

The human skin microbiome – encompassing hundreds of bacterial and fungal species – has essential roles in maintaining skin health. Skin microbiome dysfunction can contribute to diverse skin infections, inflammatory disorders, and skin cancer.
It is important to both identify the microbe–skin cell interactions that go awry in skin disease and to evaluate the therapeutic potential of new approaches for treating skin diseases. However, a detailed mechanistic understanding of how various skin microbes interact with human cells to maintain skin health or promote skin disease is currently lacking.
The goal of Julia Oh’s project is to determine how diverse skin microbes impact the essential functions of skin cells. However, there are few experimental models that allow us to investigate the diversity of skin microbes in a physiologically relevant way.
To enable a detailed investigation of microbe–skin cell interactions and their effects on skin health, Julia Oh and her team will model microbial colonization in cultured skin tissue that is genetically modified to investigate skin cell mechanisms. Then, using metabolomics and computational models, they will identify microbial metabolites to reveal microbial mechanisms.

Vasileios Bekiaris and his team have been studying the mechanisms by which psoriasis is induced for several years, and their goal was to find ways to suppress it. They have discovered a molecule that is necessary for the generation and function of the immune cells responsible for causing psoriasis. Moreover, they have access to a drug that targets and neutralizes this molecule, and therefore they thought that it could potentially inhibit psoriasis. Contrary to what they expected, the drug induced inflammation and exacerbated psoriasis instead of treating it. It is known that for many cancers, inflammation promotes favourable protective immunity and helps the efficacy of immunotherapy. Using a mouse melanoma model, Vasileios Bekiaris and his team have managed to generate data suggesting that the pro-inflammatory drug could in fact suppress tumour growth.
Vasileios Bekiaris will therefore investigate the drug’s potential in cancer treatment and, if successful, may open possibilities for a new immunotherapy against skin cancers.

Melanogenesis, the process of synthesis and storage of the pigment responsible for skin color, melanin, occurs at specialized cell organelles named melanosomes. The mechanisms underlying melanin synthesis are not fully understood, but recent data suggest that mitochondrial physiology influences melanogenesis. Marta Giacomello and her team discovered that a mitochondrial fission factor, serendipitously found at the melanosome-mitochondria interface, controls the size of early melanosomes and melanin levels independently of its role in mitochondrial morphology.
The team aims to demonstrate that the identified mitochondria fission factor is a common regulator of organelle maturation, which exerts its specific effect based on its subcellular localization and interaction partners. They will first investigate its role in melanosome maturation, and then to generalize its function by extending the analysis to lipid droplets.
By elucidating how the identified fission factor switches from its mitochondrial to its melanosomal function, Marta Giacomello may generate milestone findings in the field of melanogenesis, and proof-of-concept evidence for its general role as a master regulator of organelles’ fission and maturation.

Fellowship theme: Skin Physiology and Cutaneous Drug Delivery
  Stine Rønholt’s vision is to explore new ways to treat chronic skin issues (like eczema) directly on the skin. Today, such diseases are primarily treated by immunosuppressants, that upon systemic exposure can weaken the immune system. Atopic dermatitis is effectively treated by a type of medicine called JAK inhibitors, administered as tablets. Yet, direct administration of JAK inhibitors via the skin is hampered by the skin’s tough outer layer.
Stine Rønholt’s project will develop a new technology that treats eczema directly on the skin. To do so, Stine Rønholt is using a novel approach, “ionic liquids,” which can increase the drug solubility allowing for high dose treatment. Much like how sugar dissolves in water. This approach will help to deliver more medicine into the skin, targeting and treating eczema more effectively. Stine Rønholt’s goal is to figure out how to make this work for two specific JAK inhibitors, baricitinib and abrocitinib. Focus here is currently directed towards understanding how the ionic liquids used work together with the drugs, as well as what happens to the skin when the drug is applied. Even though the drug needs to be transported across the skin to where it is going to work, the technology should not cause any irritability to the skin. Special biophysical techniques are to be used to study all these things closely.
Stine Rønholt hopes to be able to deliver a high amount of medicine directly to a problem area without any uncomfortable procedures by using this approach.

She aims to investigate a novel concept for cellular cross-talk, mediated by vesicular structures known as extracellular vesicles (EVs), that may drive inflammation in psoriasis.
Aida Hansen’s project builds upon knowledge that psoriasis is mainly driven by pro-inflammatory cytokines, and recently, it was discovered that cytokines are partly packaged into EVs. She hypothesizes that the majority of cytokines implicated in psoriasis are carried in specific subsets of EVs constituting “pro-inflammatory packages”. She will: 1) Do an in-depth investigation of the packaging of cytokines into EVs derived from patients with severe psoriasis, 2) Investigate the functional impact of specific EV-subpopulations in driving the inflammatory response in psoriasis, and 3) Explore the therapeutic concept for neutralizing specific disease-promoting EVs in psoriasis.
Aida Hansen hopes to contribute to a deeper understanding of how cytokines are being transported between cells and the potentially different biological properties of soluble cytokines compared to cytokines packaged into EVs.

Pregnancy in patients with immune-mediated diseases like psoriasis is challenging and requires a tightly regulated immune system. The mother’s immune system must prevent rejection of the fetus that partly represents paternal characteristics and thus foreign to the mother’s immune system, while still being alert to infections threatening herself and the baby. Additionally, the immune system is important for invasion of fetal cells (trophoblast cells), into the cell lining of the womb to form a healthy placenta. Thus, a dysregulated immune system, i.e., during flares of psoriasis, can negatively affect pregnancy.
Furthermore, knowledge of the effect of biologics to treat psoriasis, anti-TNFα, anti-interleukin-17 (IL17) and anti-IL23, on pregnancy is sparse. This complicates decision making on treatment of women with psoriasis before and during pregnancy.
In this project, Renate van der Molen and her team will therefore study the effect of psoriasis and the treatment with biologics on the local uterine immune environment.

The skin protects organisms from their environment; it prevents water loss and infection and blocks physical insults. This barrier includes an outer layer and an inner, highly organized scaffold of fibers and blood vessels. Proper development of these two networks following birth is essential for health during adulthood; however, these processes are poorly understood.
Defects in the assembly and function of dermal fiber and blood vessel networks lead to severe diseases such as Systemic Sclerosis (SSc) or scleroderma. Identification of early SSc stages is crucial for the development of diagnostic, preventive, and therapeutic strategies. However, gaining this knowledge has been challenged by the inability to track these events longitudinally and in vivo.
Valentina Greco’s lab has overcome this roadblock and developed the ability for continuous visualization of skin networks, specifically how fibroblast and blood vessel networks develop after birth under healthy conditions. In this project – and building on this knowledge – they will utilize mouse models that mimic SSc in humans to investigate whether mechanisms crucial for postnatal skin maturation participate in this disease.
Valentina Greco’s project, if successful, will advance the understanding of the skin’s structural and blood vessel networks, shed light on their role in health and disease, and provide a solid foundation to improve clinical management of those suffering from often-lethal ailments such as scleroderma."

The epidermis forms the body’s outer armor from multiple layers of cells called keratinocytes, which assemble strong connections (desmosomes) to seal the skin tissue and prevent wounds. Several rare blistering disorders are linked to autoantibodies or gene mutations that disrupt desmosomes, causing keratinocyte splitting and skin breakdown. While autoimmune blistering diseases can be controlled by suppressing the immune system, treatments remain elusive for inherited blistering diseases.
One of these is Hailey-Hailey disease (HHD), which causes recurrent wounds, pain, and infections, leading to stigmatization of patients. Mutations in the ATP2C1 gene, which encodes the calcium pump SPCA1, were linked to HHD more than 20 years ago, yet the disease still lacks any approved therapies.
While it is known that SPCA1 resides in the Golgi apparatus (an organelle inside the cell responsible for protein processing and trafficking), our limited understanding of how SPCA1 deficiency compromises skin integrity has stalled drug development for HHD; moreover, mice engineered to lack SPCA1 did not replicate HHD.
Cory Simpson and his team at the University of Washington have built human cellular and tissue models of HHD to define what drives the disease and to discover new treatments. Their preliminary analysis of ATP2C1 mutant keratinocytes revealed impaired expression and trafficking of adhesive proteins, but also identified stress signals from mis-folded proteins and reactive oxygen species.
In this project, Cory Simpson and team will determine how these cellular dysfunctions compromise keratinocyte cohesion to cause skin blistering and test if cell stress pathways could serve as therapeutic targets for HHD."

Skin fibrosis is often a sequela of suboptimal wound healing following significant epidermal and/or dermal injury (burns, trauma, major surgeries). Fibrotic material replaces native skin with dense, non-functional connective tissue, ultimately leading to loss of function. In its mildest form, fibrosis is a minor aesthetic problem, but in the most severe cases it can lead to debilitating skin pathologies that result in limited movement, high morbidity, and prevention of patient reintegration into society.
Current treatments for fibrosis include physical therapy and surgery, but there are no therapies that directly target the underlying cellular and molecular mechanisms of skin fibrosis.
The spiny mouse (Acomys) is, to date, the only mammal capable of skin autotomy (i.e., self-amputation of the skin to elude a predator’s grasp). Fascinatingly, the spiny mouse completely regenerates the lost skin and regrows cartilage and appendages (nails, hair) with minimal fibrotic response.
A multimodal approach addressing the mechanisms driving spiny’s scarless regeneration may provide novel therapeutic opportunities to treat and prevent skin fibrosis.
In this project, Sofia Ferreira Gonzalez and her team investigate three questions: 1) is the spiny mouse’s scarless regeneration depending on specific cell populations, circulatory factors or a combination thereof, 2) which specific pathways are responsible for the scarless regeneration, and 3) how can the research findings be translated into novel therapeutics to improve skin wound healing in humans?"

Its pronounced skin tropism (i.e., ability to infect) promotes persistent colonization of the skin and facilitates skin-skin transmission within health care facilities, leading to life-threatening infections of high mortality in immunocompromised patients.
The lack of clinically relevant primary human skin models with a disrupted barrier function has been a serious impediment to better understand the C. auris:host interplay during pathogenesis.
To counter this, Adelheid Elbe-Bürger and her team have developed unique, standardized human ex vivo skin models that allow them to study C. auris colonization and penetration as well as identify the immune cells that orchestrate both the recognition and immune defense against this fungus.
In Adelheid Elbe-Bürger’s project infected skin biopsies will be analyzed by single-cell RNA-sequencing, flow cytometry as well as confocal microscopy. Culture supernatants will be subjected to multiplex proteomics (i.e., a way to analyze many proteins simultaneously) to decipher host components governing fungal:host interactions.
The overarching aim is that the results will advance the understanding of tissue-specific mechanisms of anti-C. auris defense and may help to pave the way for improved therapeutic options."

Year: 2023	Grantee: Mariana Oliveira, PhD, CICECO, Universidade de Aveiro	Amount: DKK 3,129,000	"Mariana Oliveira’s project investigates the potential of using de-vitalized mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) as direct or indirect immunomodulatory or regenerative biomaterials for treatment of difficult-to-treat or chronic wounds.
The project aims at exploring MSCs as constituents of off-the-shelf easy-to-handle immunomodulatory biomaterials. The project focuses on using these materials to treat difficult-to-heal wounds, which may be chronic, or have proneness to become chronic if not properly treated.
Two treatment approaches will be explored using devitalized MSC aggregates through (i) their direct use as immunomodulatory and regenerative biomaterials capable of inducing healthy tissue deposition, or (ii) by their ability to promote localized immunosuppression. The latter approach targets skin allogeneic (i.e., non-self) engraftments in order to avoid or minimize systemic immunosuppressants intake, associated with proneness to infections, higher allograft rejection rate, and severe comorbidities.
The fact that no living cells are administered is expected to improve the predictability and safety of the devices when compared to other cell-based therapies.
The technology also eliminates risks related to possible cell migration to unwanted sites, or the occurrence of phenotypic changes after implantation (e.g., loss of regenerative features or differentiation into unwanted cell phenotypes, which may be particularly relevant for highly plastic cells like MSCs).
The hope is to develop efficient treatments for wound healing with minimal risk of side effects."

Year: 2023	Grantee: Johannes Griss, MD PhD, Medical University of Vienna	Amount: DKK 3,975,754	"Johannes Griss’ project aims to elucidate the immunological memory of biologics-resistant psoriasis patients using advanced screening methodology. This, coupled with identifying immune composition in lesions, may reveal new treatment options.
Efficient treatment of cutaneous psoriasis is an example of the great success of modern biologicals. Nevertheless, a subset of patients remain that do not respond to most biologic treatments. This group remains in high need of efficient treatment options. It has been speculated that therapy-resistant psoriasis is caused by either specific compositions of the microbiome or unique previous viral infections.
Viral infections can trigger autoimmune diseases and dysregulated immune responses against the microbiome may trigger inflammatory and autoimmune diseases. However, to date it has not been possible to cover the vast space of antigens represented by the microbiome. Johannes Griss and his team recently showed that phage display libraries (PhIP-Seq, a high-troughput screening method utilizing bacteria-infecting viruses) can be used to identify and characterize antibodies against several 100,000s of antigens simultaneously instead of several 100s with conventional methods. This method can reveal both previous viral infections as well as the composition of the microbiome at large scale and low cost.
In this project, the team will use their novel PhIP-seq approach to characterize the immunologic state of a large in-house cohort of psoriasis patients. They will pair this with an in-depth characterization of the lesional immune composition. In this way, they aim to be able to test whether a patient’s immune memory alters psoriatic inflammation and influences therapy response.
If successful, their findings may reveal novel treatment approaches and biomarkers to allow optimal matching of biologic treatments."	Grant category: Research Grants in open competition	Geography: Austria	Unravelling the Link Between Past Infections, the Microbiome, and Therapy Resistant Psoriasis
Year: 2023	Grantee: Jo Lambert, Professor, Ghent University	Amount: DKK 2,601,672	"Jo Lambert’s project will conduct a clinical investigator-initiated trial to examine the feasibility of using a value-based healthcare (VBHC) framework (i.e., a healthcare delivery model in which providers, including hospitals and physicians, are paid based on patient health outcomes), in relation to psoriasis management and treatment with an aim to optimize value for patients.
The healthcare sector is under tremendous financial pressure and the quality of care varies strongly. Many acknowledge that a shift towards a sustainable system is needed. For this reason, the conceptual framework known as value-based healthcare (VBHC) is further explored in this project in which psoriasis management is taken as a model to study VBHC implementation.
The objective of Jo Lambert’s project is to investigate the feasibility of using the VBHC framework for the management of psoriasis. This is done through a prospective clinical study in which new patients attending the dedicated psoriasis clinic (PsoPlus) of the Ghent University Hospital will be followed during at least a period of 1 year. The main outcome is to determine the created value for psoriasis patients.
The created value will be considered as a reflection of the evolution of the value score (i.e., the weighted outputs (outcomes) divided by weighted inputs (costs)) obtained using data envelopment analysis (a non-parametric method to compare productive efficiency). Secondary outcomes are related to comorbidity control, outcome evolution, treatment costs and defining a bundled payment scheme.
Once completed, the findings of Jo Lambert’s project will be disseminated by various means: (1) publication in one or more peer- reviewed dermatology and/or management journals, (2) (inter)national congresses, (3) via the psoriasis patient community and (4) through the research team’s social media channels.

Year: 2023	Grantee: Friedrich Götz, Professor, University of Tübingen	Amount: DKK 2,530,167	"Friedrich Götz’s project aims to elucidate the role of bacteria-derived neurotransmitters in the development and progression of diabetic foot ulcers (DFU) and DFU-associated peripheral neuropathy (DPN).
A diabetic foot ulcer (DFU) is a poorly healing open wound that occurs in about 15% of patients with diabetes. Of those who develop DFU, 6% will be hospitalized due to infection or other ulcer-related complications. Previously, Friedrich Götz and his team have found evidence that neurotransmitter-producing bacteria of the skin (here termed neuromicrobiota) may have an impact on the healing process. However, it remains unknown whether the effects are beneficial or detrimental to wound healing.
In Friedrich Götz’s project it is hypothesized that permanent stimulation of neuronal skin receptors is more detrimental for wound healing. Through a close collaboration with the Trauma Surgery at the University Tübingen, BG Clinic Tübingen which treats ~200 DFU patients/year, samples will be analyzed for a variety of parameters, including neurotransmitter content, microbiome and metagenome composition, and impact of neurochemicals on wound healing. These will be compared to samples from healthy subjects taken at similar sites.
The goal of the project is to elucidate the role of bacteria-derived neurotransmitters in the development and progression of DFU and DFU-associated peripheral neuropathy (DPN). Friedrich Götz’s project will substantially aid the scientific understanding of DFUs and may provide potential for clinical application. If bacterial-derived neurotransmitters are found to have an impact on wound healing and progression of DFU, then this may open a new avenue for therapeutic approaches to treat DFU."

Leprosy, a neglected tropical disease of the skin, causes severe stigmatization, long term disability and mental health issues. It is treatable and preventable yet persists among the world’s poorest and most neglected citizens. To realize the goal of a leprosy-free world we need to deepen the knowledge of the disease pathophysiology and how it spreads, and ensure effective strategies to diagnose, prevent, and cure the disease and its long-term effects. Major gaps exist in the understanding of leprosy transmission which limit the efficiency of interventions to prevent infections and achieve zero transmission.
Sarah Dunstan’s project will use whole genome sequencing of the causative agent, Mycobacterium leprae, to unravel the complexities of leprosy epidemiology and persistence. The knowledge gained will also improve interventions for diagnosis, treatment, and vaccine strategies, and develop a robust framework for obtaining the zero-transmission goal in Nepal. A network of community health workers will conduct active case finding for leprosy in the community in two districts of Nepal with a high incidence of leprosy and high multidimensional poverty index (i.e., poverty in relation to health, education and living standards). Genomic epidemiology will be used to characterize subtypes of the M. leprae identified, matched to individual patients, disease transmission dynamics and drug resistance emergence. Mathematical models will inform optimized active case finding, and this will form the basis of stakeholder engagement to develop evidence-informed policy revisions in the national strategic plan for leprosy."

Year: 2023	Grantee: Thomas Sicheritz-Pontén, Professor, University of Copenhagen	Amount: DKK 3,988,469	"The project led by Thomas Sicheritz-Pontén from the Globe Institute at the University of Copenhagen, aims to carry out the fundamental work needed to develop targeted phage therapy (using bacteria-infecting viruses) to counter Necrotizing Soft Tissue Infections (NSTI).  This innovative treatment approach necessitates an in-depth understanding of the causative organisms, which will be achieved through sequencing these organisms and employing machine learning algorithms to predict their susceptibility to specific phages.
Necrotizing Soft Tissue Infections (NSTI), also known as “flesh-eating disease”, are rapidly escalating globally, posing a deadly bacterial threat that necessitates innovative therapeutic strategies due to its profound impact on human health. NSTI is characterized by aggressive skin manifestations primarily caused by Group A Streptococcus (Strep A). Although prompt surgery and antibiotics serve as the first-line treatment, infections often progress to necrosis, rendering antibiotics ineffective and often necessitating amputation and in worst case death.
Bacteriophages, or simply phages, offer a promising avenue to address this severe skin and soft tissue infection. Phages are viruses that selectively infect and eliminate bacteria, including antibiotic-resistant strains, without harming human cells.
Thomas Sicheritz-Pontén and team will do the fundamental work needed to identify prototype tailored phage therapies targeting Strep A. Along with his team, comprised of chief physicians from three different Danish hospitals, the UK Centre for Phage Research and the University of Copenhagen, Thomas Sicheritz-Pontén intends to identify phages capable of rapidly eradicating the bacteria, harness bacterial enzymes (endolysins), and employ phage satellites (mobile genetic elements that parasitize phages) for gene delivery.
By collaborating across research hubs, the team will decode Strep A’s genetic makeup, thereby facilitating the creation of precise phage cocktails and develop a novel molecular typing system to predict bacterial susceptibility, streamlining targeted phage treatments.
If successful, Thomas Sicheritz-Pontén’s project may greatly aid the battle against deadly NSTI infections through innovative development of phage therapy."

Year: 2023	Grantee: Peggy Myung, Associate Professor, Yale University	Amount: DKK 2,135,432	"Peggy Myung’s project aims to elucidate how two key molecular signals regulate the development of dermal condensate cells, a group of cells pivotal for hair formation.
The hair follicle dermal condensate (DC) is a cluster of quiescent dermal cells that can induce new hair follicle formation and holds the potential to revolutionize hair loss treatments. However, a key barrier to exploiting DCs to make new hair is that the molecular and cellular mechanisms that lead to DC formation are poorly understood.
Peggy Myung and her team recently identified two morphogen signals that are necessary and sufficient to drive DC formation. These two signals cooperate to unfold an initial stage of progenitor proliferation followed by a stage of cell cycle exit and DC maturation. Importantly, these stages of differentiation depend on levels of these two signals: Low levels induce progenitor proliferation; higher levels induce quiescence and DC maturation.
They hypothesize that different signaling levels regulate these stages of differentiation by inducing distinct signature genes that cause either DC progenitor expansion or terminal differentiation. They recently established a high-throughput dermal culture system to test this hypothesis. Using this novel platform and in vivo hair reconstitution assays, they aim to define how modulation of levels of these two signals regulates dermal gene expression profiles, cell cycle dynamics and DC function.
If successful, Peggy Myung’s project may define tunable molecular targets to develop novel treatments for hair loss and to make DC organoids for drug testing."	Grant category: Research Grants in open competition	Geography: USA	Programming dermal fibroblasts to stimulate hair follicle regeneration
Year: 2023	Grantee: Simon Bekker-Jensen, Professor, University of Copenhagen, Center for Healthy Aging	Amount: DKK 3,823,440	"Simon Bekker-Jensen’s project investigates the potential role of the NLRP1 (Nucleotide-Binding Oligomerization Domain, Leucine Rich Repeat and Pyrin Domain Containing 1) inflammasome in combination with the upstream activator Ribotoxic Stress Response (RSR) in AD and psoriasis.
Inflammatory and hyperproliferative skin diseases, including atopic dermatitis (AD) and psoriasis, are associated with cascades of inflammatory events. A key player in innate skin immunity is the NLRP1 inflammasome, which mediates inflammation and cell death in response to a wide array of stress insults. In human keratinocytes, NLRP1 was recently shown by Simon Bekker-Jensen’s team and others to be activated by the Ribotoxic Stress Response (RSR) upon exposure to UV-B irradiation and a range of bacterial toxins.
Based on their preliminary data demonstrating that the RSR also mediates inflammation and keratinocyte hyperproliferation in vivo, the team hypothesize that these pathways have broader implications for the pathogenesis of inflammatory skin diseases.
In Simon Bekker-Jensen’s project, the validity of the RSR as a therapeutic target in the common inflammatory skin diseases psoriasis and AD will be explored. By genetic deletion and pharmacological inhibition of the RSR, the team will interrogate this pathway in several mouse models of inflammatory skin diseases. In addition, they will generate a humanized NLRP1 mouse model to study the RSR-NLRP1 signaling axis in vivo. Finally, by using 3D organotypic skin models and skin biopsies from patients, they aim to firmly establish the role of the RSR in psoriasis and AD.
The long-term goal is to leverage this insight to develop new therapeutic options for the management and treatment of inflammatory skin diseases."	Grant category: Research Grants in open competition	Geography: Denmark	The ribotoxic stress response in inflammatory skin disease
Year: 2023	Grantee: Laura Mackay, Professor, University of Melbourne	Amount: DKK 3,826,119	"Laura Mackay’s project investigates how tissue-resident T cell (TRM) populations in skin vary in development and function across body surfaces exposed to different environmental factors.
The generation of optimal immunotherapies requires effective T cell responses. Whilst some T cells patrol the blood, a unique subset called tissue-resident memory T (TRM) cells permanently exist within the tissues of the body. T cells that reside in the skin comprise distinct populations that differentially contribute to protecting the skin against disease.
The previous work of Laura Mackay and her team has demonstrated that different populations of skin-resident T cells in mice rely on separate molecular processes to function effectively. However, understanding of how human skin-resident T cells develop and control infectious insults and inflammatory disorders remains limited.
This project aims to determine skin TRM cell variation across the body, encompassing skin sites exposed to different environmental factors, such as sun exposure and hair follicle density, as well as in the context of disease. The team will seek to define the molecules that enhance skin-resident T cell function and survival, thus identifying factors that may prevent disease in healthy skin.
Overall, the aim is to generate fundamental new knowledge about the regulation of skin immunity and homeostasis. This knowledge is critical for the development of treatments and immunotherapies to harness T cell immunity for skin disorders."

Year: 2023	Grantee: Clarissa Schwab, Associate Professor, Aarhus University	Amount: DKK 3,910,741	"Clarissa Schwab’s project aims to investigate the role of switching from liquid to solid diet in the development of AD during infancy.
Atopic dermatitis (AD) is one of the first manifestations of allergic diseases that occur in early life. In industrial countries, up to 30% of children suffer from AD imposing an enormous burden to the quality of life and to health systems.
Not all factors contributing to the occurrence of AD are known, but the development of the gut microbiota in relation to a switch from liquid to solid diet during the first year of life might play an important role.
This project, ‘Infant AD’, suggests that a combination of specific food components and the appearance of certain gut bacteria is critical to producing gut metabolites that affect the immune system, and ultimately the state of the skin. To tackle such a complex system at the interface of diet, microbiome and the host, the concept of Infant AD is based on a unique combination of microbial and/or nutritional intervention studies using in vitro and in vivo models with state-of-the-art microbiome and metabolome analysis that will be supported by data collected from the Swiss birth cohort Childhood, Allergy, Nutrition and Environment (CARE).
Infant AD may shed further light on the complex interactions between diet, microbial activity and the immune system that could lead to novel measures to lower the risk of AD development in infancy."

Year: 2023	Grantee: Caroline Le Poole, Professor, Northwestern University	Amount: DKK 2,979,828	"Caroline Le Poole’s project aims to investigate the potential link between the gut microbiome composition and vitiligo development.
The etiology of vitiligo involves a complex hereditary component, as well as environmental factors that precipitate disease. Caroline Le Poole and her team initially asked whether the gut microbiome impacts T cell-mediated autoimmune depigmentation. Manipulating the gut microbiome by oral antibiotics, they demonstrated a significant impact on vitiligo development in an established mouse model of the disease. Specifically, when using ampicillin to favor gut colonization by Pseudomonas species, they observed accelerated vitiligo development. Meanwhile, neomycin treatment was associated with an abundance of Bacteroides species in the gut, while mice in this group did not develop measurable depigmentation. These and other findings suggest that specific microbes can influence vitiligo development.
Here, they will test the hypothesis that the microbiome is a causative pathogenic factor fueling the autoimmune response to melanocytes causing the hallmark progressive depigmentation seen in vitiligo. The team will use mouse and human fecal transplants and manipulate the diet of vitiligo-prone mice. Moreover, individual microbial species will be introduced into germ-free mice before assessing depigmentation kinetics. Ultimately, therapeutic benefit may be derived from promoting the species that support regulatory T cell activity."

Year: 2023	Grantee: Blaine Fritz, Postdoc, University of Copenhagen	Amount: DKK 2,956,179	"Blaine Fritz’s project investigates the ongoing genetic changes and interactions between bacteria and patients’ skin during development of atopic dermatitis to identify novel putative treatment targets.
Atopic dermatitis (AD) is one of the most common skin diseases, affecting up to 20% of children and 10% of adults. AD presents as localized, itching patches of eczema, frequently first observed during childhood and often persisting throughout the patient’s life.
Dysregulated immune response, microbial imbalances, and skin barrier dysfunction are among several, interacting factors, which invoke and perpetuate AD. In up to 90% of patients, aggressive pathogens such as Staphylococcus aureus displace the protective microbiota of the skin resulting in reduced microbial diversity and increased lesion severity. Clinicians commonly utilize antibiotics to treat bacterial infection in AD, but the efficacy is unclear and antibiotic treatment increases the probability of resistance.
The mechanisms and specific gene targets involved in host-microbial interactions by both commensal (non-pathogenic) and infecting bacteria are not well studied. This project hypothesizes that both protective and pathogenic bacteria on the skin dynamically activate specific host-genes and pathways during progression of an AD flare. To test this hypothesis, Blaine Fritz will utilize an integrated, machine-learning-based approach to identify longitudinal (i.e., over time) changes in gene-expression associated with the presence of specific bacteria during flare and treatment to identify direct, host-microbial interactions.
The findings will aid in elucidating bacteria’s role in AD and may guide antibiotic treatment, as well as identify novel targets for antibiotic-independent treatments."

Year: 2023	Grantee: Ludvig Sollid, Professor, University of Oslo	Amount: DKK 3,996,277	"Ludvig Sollid’s project aims to improve the understanding of the pathogenic immune responses in dermatitis herpetiformis and hereby design and investigate potential new therapeutics for the disease.
Dermatitis Herpetiformis (DH) is a chronic autoimmune bullous skin disease characterised by itchy blisters localised at specific surfaces of the body. DH can be considered a cutaneous manifestation of the gluten sensitive condition Coeliac Disease (CeD). The treatment for DH, as it is for CeD, is a life-long gluten-free diet and therefore novel treatments are sought for.
The diagnosis of DH is made by detection of granular IgA deposits in the dermis layer of the skin. These IgA deposits are immune complexes involving the autoantigen transglutaminase 3 (TG3) which is expressed in the epidermis, the outmost layer that sits above the dermis.
In this project Ludvig Sollid and his team aim to dissect the immunopathogenesis of DH, specifically addressing the mechanism for the generation of TG3 autoantibodies. Based on a model for the generation of autoantibodies to another transglutaminase (transglutaminase 2, TG2) in CeD, they will explore whether B cells carrying B-cell receptors isolated from DH patients, can bind complexes of TG3 and gluten peptides and thereby present gluten peptides to T cells so that T-cell help is provided.
Specifically, they will characterise the substrate binding site of TG3, identify the preferred gluten peptide substrates for TG3, and also characterise, in detail, the structural basis for binding of DH autoantibodies including antibodies that augment TG3 activity.
Based on these new insights, the team will design TG3 inhibitors which have potential therapeutic usage for treatment of DH along with a TG2 inhibitor which recently proved efficacious for treatment of CeD.

Year: 2015	Grantee: Department of Pharmacy, University of Copenhagen	Amount: DKK 40,000,000	"Understanding how drugs interact with skin has long been a challenge within pharmaceutical research. Now, a new center at the Department of Pharmacy, UCPH, is set to become an international lighthouse in this research area, supported by a DKK 40 million grant from the LEO Foundation.
The LEO Foundation Center for Cutaneous Drug Delivery will form the basis of new research on skin and drugs. Behind the project is the Department of Pharmacy at the University of Copenhagen, where the center will also be located. The Director of the new center, Martin Malmsten, was formerly Head of Research at Uppsala University.
“I hope to contribute with my experience and thus help motivate and inspire colleagues and employees, enabling us to provide the best possible results. At the same time, I look forward to becoming part of the University of Copenhagen, where they have been very willing to prioritize strategic focus areas. The new center offers great and long-term opportunities for making an impact on international research and I’m happy to be part of this initiative, which will lift research in a very exciting area,” said Martin Malmsten.
The LEO Foundation Center for Cutaneous Drug Delivery will conduct research on what happens in and on the skin when we apply drugs. There will be a particular focus on the physical-chemical aspects of the interaction between skin and drugs, which is important to the development of new drugs. This will hopefully help optimize the drug properties and allow for maximum utilization while simultaneously minimizing side effects.
“Our new center meets a huge demand for understanding how drugs interact with skin. With a strong team of highly qualified researchers, we will set new standards for research in the field of dermatology and I’m both proud and grateful that this grant from the LEO Foundation has helped us attract new and strong forces to UCPH. This new strategic effort will benefit patients as well as society in general,” said Dean Ulla Wewer from the Department of Health and Medical Sciences at the University of Copenhagen.
Generating new knowledge while also providing a space for innovative research methods and new analytical technologies is what the center aims for. The LEO Foundation has backed the center with a grant of DKK 40 million over the next ten years, which in itself is quite remarkable.
“We’re very happy to support this important initiative and the grant of DKK 40 million over the next ten years is the single largest grant the foundation has ever awarded. What’s more important, however, is the fact that we are quite convinced that the center with its strong team of researchers has the potential to become a global powerhouse in terms of research on the dynamic interaction between drugs and skin,” said Lars Olsen, Chairman of the LEO Foundation."

Dr. Zielinski’s research focuses on how the body’s immune system protects itself from microbial assault by distinguishing between the body’s own cells and foreign organisms. It examines what happens when the body does not regulate itself in this way and how this affects the development of autoimmune diseases such as psoriasis and multiple sclerosis. Insights gained from these studies are expected to identify molecular cues that can be exploited in order to develop immune modulation therapies."

Dr. Jensen’s research focuses on how the epidermis, the outer layer of the skin, is constantly renewed throughout life in an organised manner by epidermal stem cells. Epidermal stem cells need to be carefully controlled as any imbalance is likely to have devastating consequences. Too little contribution from the stem cells can lead to bleeding ulcers, whereas too much contribution can lead to skin cancer. By examining how stem cells are regulated in the epidermis, Jensen hopes to gain insights into mechanisms responsible for disease development and identify new drugable pathways."

While considerable research exists on adults with psoriasis, there is little research on the condition in children. Identifying key factors associated with psoriasis in childhood may lead to more effective control and possibly even prevention of the condition.
The study aims to determine environmental and genetic risk factors relating to the development of psoriasis in children, the nature of stress related to the child and family, and quality of life. The project also aims to determine the link with risk factors of co-morbidity and the effect of early intensive treatment.
The study is led by Professor Lone Skov, Department of Dermato-Allergology, Gentofte Hospital, Denmark. The team will explore the following hypotheses:
Risk factors for early onset of psoriasis can be predicted
Early debut of psoriasis has a significant impact on quality of life and individual and family-related stress
Early intensive treatment leads to remission
There is already an increased risk of co-morbidity in children with psoriasis
Age at debut, risk factors and co-morbidity are related
to the genetic risk.

Year: 2015	Grantee: Department of Pharmacy, University of Copenhagen	Amount: DKK 40,000,000	"Understanding how drugs interact with skin has long been a challenge within pharmaceutical research. Now, a new center at the Department of Pharmacy, UCPH, is set to become an international lighthouse in this research area, supported by a DKK 40 million grant from the LEO Foundation.
The LEO Foundation Center for Cutaneous Drug Delivery will form the basis of new research on skin and drugs. Behind the project is the Department of Pharmacy at the University of Copenhagen, where the center will also be located. The Director of the new center, Martin Malmsten, was formerly Head of Research at Uppsala University.
“I hope to contribute with my experience and thus help motivate and inspire colleagues and employees, enabling us to provide the best possible results. At the same time, I look forward to becoming part of the University of Copenhagen, where they have been very willing to prioritize strategic focus areas. The new center offers great and long-term opportunities for making an impact on international research and I’m happy to be part of this initiative, which will lift research in a very exciting area,” said Martin Malmsten.
The LEO Foundation Center for Cutaneous Drug Delivery will conduct research on what happens in and on the skin when we apply drugs. There will be a particular focus on the physical-chemical aspects of the interaction between skin and drugs, which is important to the development of new drugs. This will hopefully help optimize the drug properties and allow for maximum utilization while simultaneously minimizing side effects.
“Our new center meets a huge demand for understanding how drugs interact with skin. With a strong team of highly qualified researchers, we will set new standards for research in the field of dermatology and I’m both proud and grateful that this grant from the LEO Foundation has helped us attract new and strong forces to UCPH. This new strategic effort will benefit patients as well as society in general,” said Dean Ulla Wewer from the Department of Health and Medical Sciences at the University of Copenhagen.
Generating new knowledge while also providing a space for innovative research methods and new analytical technologies is what the center aims for. The LEO Foundation has backed the center with a grant of DKK 40 million over the next ten years, which in itself is quite remarkable.
“We’re very happy to support this important initiative and the grant of DKK 40 million over the next ten years is the single largest grant the foundation has ever awarded. What’s more important, however, is the fact that we are quite convinced that the center with its strong team of researchers has the potential to become a global powerhouse in terms of research on the dynamic interaction between drugs and skin,” said Lars Olsen, Chairman of the LEO Foundation."

While considerable research exists on adults with psoriasis, there is little research on the condition in children. Identifying key factors associated with psoriasis in childhood may lead to more effective control and possibly even prevention of the condition.
The study aims to determine environmental and genetic risk factors relating to the development of psoriasis in children, the nature of stress related to the child and family, and quality of life. The project also aims to determine the link with risk factors of co-morbidity and the effect of early intensive treatment.
The study is led by Professor Lone Skov, Department of Dermato-Allergology, Gentofte Hospital, Denmark. The team will explore the following hypotheses:
Risk factors for early onset of psoriasis can be predicted
Early debut of psoriasis has a significant impact on quality of life and individual and family-related stress
Early intensive treatment leads to remission
There is already an increased risk of co-morbidity in children with psoriasis
Age at debut, risk factors and co-morbidity are related
to the genetic risk.
The study offers a unique possibility to access data from children with psoriasis shortly after diagnosis, which in turn can pave the way for new and improved tools for assessing the impact of the condition on quality of life in a well-controlled study design."

A team led by Professor Martin Steinhoff, University of California San Francisco, has set out to develop novel targeted therapies for chronic itch in humans.
Besides the lesional and non-lesional as compared to healthy skin, the project team will also identify critical itch mediators and/or receptors that are expressed (and activated) in human dorsal root ganglion (DRG) and spinal cord tissue. To address this, mediators will be identified as well as receptors associated with human itch, and thereby the team will be able to define “biomarkers” for the different pruritic human diseases.
The project will be the first-of-a-kind study to analyse the expression and distribution of key itch mediators and receptors in human skin, human DRG and human spinal cord, and will therefore provide a significant basis for future translational research that targets these mediators/receptors in the different subtypes of itch.

Year: 2013	Grantee: Professor Martin Steinhoff, University of California San Francisco	Amount: USD 388,225	"Itch is probably the most common symptom in dermatology and it is associated with a significant impact on the patient’s life.
A team led by Professor Martin Steinhoff, University of California San Francisco, has set out to develop novel targeted therapies for chronic itch in humans.
Besides the lesional and non-lesional as compared to healthy skin, the project team will also identify critical itch mediators and/or receptors that are expressed (and activated) in human dorsal root ganglion (DRG) and spinal cord tissue. To address this, mediators will be identified as well as receptors associated with human itch, and thereby the team will be able to define “biomarkers” for the different pruritic human diseases.
The project will be the first-of-a-kind study to analyse the expression and distribution of key itch mediators and receptors in human skin, human DRG and human spinal cord, and will therefore provide a significant basis for future translational research that targets these mediators/receptors in the different subtypes of itch.
Moreover, it is the first time that it will be tested whether several new itch pathways that have been described in murine skin models are relevant, i.e. can be translated, in human disease state."

Year: 2015	Grantee: Department of Pharmacy, University of Copenhagen	Amount: DKK 40,000,000	"Understanding how drugs interact with skin has long been a challenge within pharmaceutical research. Now, a new center at the Department of Pharmacy, UCPH, is set to become an international lighthouse in this research area, supported by a DKK 40 million grant from the LEO Foundation.
The LEO Foundation Center for Cutaneous Drug Delivery will form the basis of new research on skin and drugs. Behind the project is the Department of Pharmacy at the University of Copenhagen, where the center will also be located. The Director of the new center, Martin Malmsten, was formerly Head of Research at Uppsala University.
“I hope to contribute with my experience and thus help motivate and inspire colleagues and employees, enabling us to provide the best possible results. At the same time, I look forward to becoming part of the University of Copenhagen, where they have been very willing to prioritize strategic focus areas. The new center offers great and long-term opportunities for making an impact on international research and I’m happy to be part of this initiative, which will lift research in a very exciting area,” said Martin Malmsten.
The LEO Foundation Center for Cutaneous Drug Delivery will conduct research on what happens in and on the skin when we apply drugs. There will be a particular focus on the physical-chemical aspects of the interaction between skin and drugs, which is important to the development of new drugs. This will hopefully help optimize the drug properties and allow for maximum utilization while simultaneously minimizing side effects.
“Our new center meets a huge demand for understanding how drugs interact with skin. With a strong team of highly qualified researchers, we will set new standards for research in the field of dermatology and I’m both proud and grateful that this grant from the LEO Foundation has helped us attract new and strong forces to UCPH. This new strategic effort will benefit patients as well as society in general,” said Dean Ulla Wewer from the Department of Health and Medical Sciences at the University of Copenhagen.
Generating new knowledge while also providing a space for innovative research methods and new analytical technologies is what the center aims for. The LEO Foundation has backed the center with a grant of DKK 40 million over the next ten years, which in itself is quite remarkable.
“We’re very happy to support this important initiative and the grant of DKK 40 million over the next ten years is the single largest grant the foundation has ever awarded. What’s more important, however, is the fact that we are quite convinced that the center with its strong team of researchers has the potential to become a global powerhouse in terms of research on the dynamic interaction between drugs and skin,” said Lars Olsen, Chairman of the LEO Foundation."

Dr. Jensen’s research focuses on how the epidermis, the outer layer of the skin, is constantly renewed throughout life in an organised manner by epidermal stem cells. Epidermal stem cells need to be carefully controlled as any imbalance is likely to have devastating consequences. Too little contribution from the stem cells can lead to bleeding ulcers, whereas too much contribution can lead to skin cancer. By examining how stem cells are regulated in the epidermis, Jensen hopes to gain insights into mechanisms responsible for disease development and identify new drugable pathways."

Year: 2014	Grantee: Dr. Christina Zielinski	Amount: DKK 500,000	"Presented to Dr. med. Christina Zielinski, research group leader and dermatological fellow, Department of Dermatology and Allergology and Berlin-Brandenburg Center for Regenerative Therapies, Charité University Medicine, Berlin.
Dr. Zielinski’s research focuses on how the body’s immune system protects itself from microbial assault by distinguishing between the body’s own cells and foreign organisms. It examines what happens when the body does not regulate itself in this way and how this affects the development of autoimmune diseases such as psoriasis and multiple sclerosis. Insights gained from these studies are expected to identify molecular cues that can be exploited in order to develop immune modulation therapies."

Year: 2014	Grantee: Dr. Kim B. Jensen	Amount: DKK 1,000,000	"Presented to Ph.D. Kim B. Jensen, associate professor at the Biotech Research and Innovation Centre at the University of Copenhagen.
Dr. Jensen’s research focuses on how the epidermis, the outer layer of the skin, is constantly renewed throughout life in an organised manner by epidermal stem cells. Epidermal stem cells need to be carefully controlled as any imbalance is likely to have devastating consequences. Too little contribution from the stem cells can lead to bleeding ulcers, whereas too much contribution can lead to skin cancer. By examining how stem cells are regulated in the epidermis, Jensen hopes to gain insights into mechanisms responsible for disease development and identify new drugable pathways."

Year: 2014	Grantee: Professor Lone Skov, Department of Dermato-Allergology, Gentofte Hospital	Amount: DKK 4,500,000	"Psoriasis is a chronic inflammatory skin condition with a prevalence of 2-3% in northern Europe. While considerable research exists on adults with psoriasis, there is little research on the condition in children. Identifying key factors associated with psoriasis in childhood may lead to more effective control and possibly even prevention of the condition.
The study aims to determine environmental and genetic risk factors relating to the development of psoriasis in children, the nature of stress related to the child and family, and quality of life. The project also aims to determine the link with risk factors of co-morbidity and the effect of early intensive treatment.
The study is led by Professor Lone Skov, Department of Dermato-Allergology, Gentofte Hospital, Denmark. The team will explore the following hypotheses:
Risk factors for early onset of psoriasis can be predicted
Early debut of psoriasis has a significant impact on quality of life and individual and family-related stress
Early intensive treatment leads to remission
There is already an increased risk of co-morbidity in children with psoriasis
Age at debut, risk factors and co-morbidity are related
to the genetic risk.
The study offers a unique possibility to access data from children with psoriasis shortly after diagnosis, which in turn can pave the way for new and improved tools for assessing the impact of the condition on quality of life in a well-controlled study design."

A team led by Professor Martin Steinhoff, University of California San Francisco, has set out to develop novel targeted therapies for chronic itch in humans.
Besides the lesional and non-lesional as compared to healthy skin, the project team will also identify critical itch mediators and/or receptors that are expressed (and activated) in human dorsal root ganglion (DRG) and spinal cord tissue. To address this, mediators will be identified as well as receptors associated with human itch, and thereby the team will be able to define “biomarkers” for the different pruritic human diseases.
The project will be the first-of-a-kind study to analyse the expression and distribution of key itch mediators and receptors in human skin, human DRG and human spinal cord, and will therefore provide a significant basis for future translational research that targets these mediators/receptors in the different subtypes of itch.
Moreover, it is the first time that it will be tested whether several new itch pathways that have been described in murine skin models are relevant, i.e. can be translated, in human disease state."

Year: 2015	Grantee: Department of Pharmacy, University of Copenhagen	Amount: DKK 40,000,000	"Understanding how drugs interact with skin has long been a challenge within pharmaceutical research. Now, a new center at the Department of Pharmacy, UCPH, is set to become an international lighthouse in this research area, supported by a DKK 40 million grant from the LEO Foundation.
The LEO Foundation Center for Cutaneous Drug Delivery will form the basis of new research on skin and drugs. Behind the project is the Department of Pharmacy at the University of Copenhagen, where the center will also be located. The Director of the new center, Martin Malmsten, was formerly Head of Research at Uppsala University.
“I hope to contribute with my experience and thus help motivate and inspire colleagues and employees, enabling us to provide the best possible results. At the same time, I look forward to becoming part of the University of Copenhagen, where they have been very willing to prioritize strategic focus areas. The new center offers great and long-term opportunities for making an impact on international research and I’m happy to be part of this initiative, which will lift research in a very exciting area,” said Martin Malmsten.
The LEO Foundation Center for Cutaneous Drug Delivery will conduct research on what happens in and on the skin when we apply drugs. There will be a particular focus on the physical-chemical aspects of the interaction between skin and drugs, which is important to the development of new drugs. This will hopefully help optimize the drug properties and allow for maximum utilization while simultaneously minimizing side effects.

Year: 2015	Grantee: Associate Professor Kiarash Khosrotehrani, University of Queensland	Amount: AUD 415,386	"In this study, Associate Professor Kiarash Khosrotehrani of The University of Queensland in Australia proposes to better characterise the molecular nature of the factors provided by fibroblasts to support basal cell carcinoma (BCC) growth in vivo in order to find new targets for therapies that would prevent BCC development. He and his team will also show proof of principle demonstrating that targeting this process can actually prevent BCC development.
These findings have the potential to translate in effective prevention strategies, allowing field therapy of normal looking skin to avoid the development of new BCCs. Such finding will have strong health benefits in terms of morbidity associated with multiple surgeries, years of healthy life enjoyed by individuals and finally in terms of economic cost."

Year: 2015	Grantee: Department of Pharmacy, University of Copenhagen	Amount: DKK 40,000,000	"Understanding how drugs interact with skin has long been a challenge within pharmaceutical research. Now, a new center at the Department of Pharmacy, UCPH, is set to become an international lighthouse in this research area, supported by a DKK 40 million grant from the LEO Foundation.
The LEO Foundation Center for Cutaneous Drug Delivery will form the basis of new research on skin and drugs. Behind the project is the Department of Pharmacy at the University of Copenhagen, where the center will also be located. The Director of the new center, Martin Malmsten, was formerly Head of Research at Uppsala University.
“I hope to contribute with my experience and thus help motivate and inspire colleagues and employees, enabling us to provide the best possible results. At the same time, I look forward to becoming part of the University of Copenhagen, where they have been very willing to prioritize strategic focus areas. The new center offers great and long-term opportunities for making an impact on international research and I’m happy to be part of this initiative, which will lift research in a very exciting area,” said Martin Malmsten.
The LEO Foundation Center for Cutaneous Drug Delivery will conduct research on what happens in and on the skin when we apply drugs. There will be a particular focus on the physical-chemical aspects of the interaction between skin and drugs, which is important to the development of new drugs. This will hopefully help optimize the drug properties and allow for maximum utilization while simultaneously minimizing side effects.
“Our new center meets a huge demand for understanding how drugs interact with skin. With a strong team of highly qualified researchers, we will set new standards for research in the field of dermatology and I’m both proud and grateful that this grant from the LEO Foundation has helped us attract new and strong forces to UCPH. This new strategic effort will benefit patients as well as society in general,” said Dean Ulla Wewer from the Department of Health and Medical Sciences at the University of Copenhagen.
Generating new knowledge while also providing a space for innovative research methods and new analytical technologies is what the center aims for. The LEO Foundation has backed the center with a grant of DKK 40 million over the next ten years, which in itself is quite remarkable.
“We’re very happy to support this important initiative and the grant of DKK 40 million over the next ten years is the single largest grant the foundation has ever awarded. What’s more important, however, is the fact that we are quite convinced that the center with its strong team of researchers has the potential to become a global powerhouse in terms of research on the dynamic interaction between drugs and skin,” said Lars Olsen, Chairman of the LEO Foundation."

Dr. Jensen’s research focuses on how the epidermis, the outer layer of the skin, is constantly renewed throughout life in an organised manner by epidermal stem cells. Epidermal stem cells need to be carefully controlled as any imbalance is likely to have devastating consequences. Too little contribution from the stem cells can lead to bleeding ulcers, whereas too much contribution can lead to skin cancer. By examining how stem cells are regulated in the epidermis, Jensen hopes to gain insights into mechanisms responsible for disease development and identify new drugable pathways."

Year: 2014	Grantee: Professor Lone Skov, Department of Dermato-Allergology, Gentofte Hospital	Amount: DKK 4,500,000	"Psoriasis is a chronic inflammatory skin condition with a prevalence of 2-3% in northern Europe. While considerable research exists on adults with psoriasis, there is little research on the condition in children. Identifying key factors associated with psoriasis in childhood may lead to more effective control and possibly even prevention of the condition.
The study aims to determine environmental and genetic risk factors relating to the development of psoriasis in children, the nature of stress related to the child and family, and quality of life. The project also aims to determine the link with risk factors of co-morbidity and the effect of early intensive treatment.
The study is led by Professor Lone Skov, Department of Dermato-Allergology, Gentofte Hospital, Denmark. The team will explore the following hypotheses:
Risk factors for early onset of psoriasis can be predicted
Early debut of psoriasis has a significant impact on quality of life and individual and family-related stress
Early intensive treatment leads to remission
There is already an increased risk of co-morbidity in children with psoriasis
Age at debut, risk factors and co-morbidity are related
to the genetic risk.
The study offers a unique possibility to access data from children with psoriasis shortly after diagnosis, which in turn can pave the way for new and improved tools for assessing the impact of the condition on quality of life in a well-controlled study design."

Year: 2013	Grantee: Professor Martin Steinhoff, University of California San Francisco	Amount: USD 388,225	"Itch is probably the most common symptom in dermatology and it is associated with a significant impact on the patient’s life.
A team led by Professor Martin Steinhoff, University of California San Francisco, has set out to develop novel targeted therapies for chronic itch in humans.
Besides the lesional and non-lesional as compared to healthy skin, the project team will also identify critical itch mediators and/or receptors that are expressed (and activated) in human dorsal root ganglion (DRG) and spinal cord tissue. To address this, mediators will be identified as well as receptors associated with human itch, and thereby the team will be able to define “biomarkers” for the different pruritic human diseases.
The project will be the first-of-a-kind study to analyse the expression and distribution of key itch mediators and receptors in human skin, human DRG and human spinal cord, and will therefore provide a significant basis for future translational research that targets these mediators/receptors in the different subtypes of itch.
Moreover, it is the first time that it will be tested whether several new itch pathways that have been described in murine skin models are relevant, i.e. can be translated, in human disease state."

Year: 2013	Grantee: Professor Lieve Brochez, University of Ghent	Amount: EUR 330,000	"Skin cancer is currently the most frequent type of cancer. At present, life-time risk is estimated at one in six and, with an ageing population, this is expected to increase even more. It is assumed that early detection allows better cure rates and more cost-effective treatment, and skin cancer thus seems suitable for screening initiatives. However, questions remain about the cost–benefit ratio.
This study is led by Professor Lieve Brochez of the University of Ghent, Belgium. It aims to calculate the actual cost of skin cancer in Belgium, the expected cost with an ageing population and how much early detection of skin cancer could affect these costs.
The team will use the results to develop an internationally applicable health-economic model. The model will allow other European countries to use local data, enabling data to be compared across Europe.
Secondly, the study will evaluate a new skin cancer screening approach to compare the yield of this type of screening to the yield of systematic screening in an asymptomatic population within a well-defined population.
Quality of life will be assessed for all screened persons with skin cancer and/or actinic keratosis in order to generate patient-centric data to evaluate the burden of skin cancer."

Year: 2013	Grantee: Dr. Emma Guttman, MD, PhD, Associate Professor of Dermatology, Director Laboratory for Inflammatory Skin Diseases, Icahn School of Medicine, Mount Sinai, New York	Amount: USD 1,046,400	"Despite considerable impact on quality of life, atopic dermatitis, or eczema, has not been studied extensively in children although as many as one in five experience the condition. Atopic dermatitis, or eczema, is a chronic skin condition, characterised by itching and inflammation, and frequently occurs in people who have other allergic conditions, such as asthma and hay fever.
Dr. Guttman has set out to define the skin and blood biomarkers of atopic dermatitis in children. She and her team will investigate how skin biomarkers compare to disease activity, epidermal barrier function and known biomarkers in adults with atopic dermatitis. They will also investigate whether blood biomarkers could offer a less invasive way to monitor skin changes than a skin biopsy, which can be difficult to perform in children.
With better knowledge of what causes atopic dermatitis in children, the researchers hope to develop more targeted therapies for the disorder as well as for other atopic conditions, such as asthma and hay fever. Together, these three disorders form an “atopic triad”.

Year: 2012	Grantee: Dr. Harry Slaper, Laboratory for Radiation Research, RIVM, Holland	Amount: DKK 200,000	"Dr. Harry Slaper, Laboratory for Radiation Research, RIVM, Holland, has developed a unique model, the AMOUR 2.0, for relating ozone depletion scenarios and UV to changes in skin cancer incidence (melanoma, basal cell carcinoma (BCC) and squamous cell carcinoma (SCC)). This model has been used since 2008 as a reference for other researchers in Europe.
The model, however, does not factor in age. Apart from cumulated UV Radiation, age is the major risk factor for the development of Non Melanoma Skin Cancer (NMSC), and an ageing population will contribute to the increasing incidence of NMSCs.
The LEO Foundation has funded a development of the model to also incorporate the effects of population aging in Europe in order to obtain a more precise picture of the projected incidence of NMSC in Europe.
Based on the Dutch Cancer registry and the enhanced model, then, Dr. Slaper has estimated age and gender specific incidence rates, incorporated them into the model as well as UN Population forecasts to forecast the incidence of NMSC in Europe and the contribution of both cumulated UV radiation and age and gender.
The results are expected to play a key role in raising awareness among decision makers in the health care sector on the increasing incidences of non-melanoma skin cancer, an awareness which will also benefit patients as the long-term aim is to increase the political prioritisation of non-melanoma skin cancer."

itching and may also pave the way for new anti-itch treatments.
The study is led by Dr Gil Yosipovitch, MD, Professor of the Department of Dermatology at Wake Forest School of Medicine, Winston-Salem, North Carolina, USA, and seeks to investigate aspects of itching in patients with atopic dermatitis and psoriasis.
Itching affects millions of people worldwide and represents a significant medical challenge as no mechanism-specific treatments are currently available. The genetic aspects of itching in chronic pruritic conditions such as atopic dermatitis and psoriasis are also rather under-investigated.
Dr Gil Yosipovitch will examine the expression of genes, neuropeptides and other itch-specific mediators specifically implicated in atopic dermatitis and psoriasis in comparison to healthy controls.
The exploration of this area may hold good news for patients, as the findings may be useful in developing new anti-itch treatments.

The work aims to shed more light on the incidence of eczema in the general population and pave the way for improved prevention and treatment.
Eczema is the most prevalent of the skin disorders. It is not only one of the most common childhood diseases, but also a typical occupational disease, making it one of the most widespread diseases in the overall population. Eczema also results in substantial costs and loss of quality of life for patients.
Despite the disease prevalence, there is a shortage of data and research on eczema in the general population.
This project, which draws on a number of databases and disease registries unique to Denmark, aims to produce a detailed picture of the clinical and sociodemographic aspects of eczema in both the general population and the patient population.
Its specific aims are:
To describe the consequences of eczema in terms of health care, education and employment, and the development of co-morbidities
To explore the genetics behind eczema and its
consequences.

This initiative was part of a national ‘keep an eye on your skin’ awareness campaign run by the Danish Pharmacy Association with Professor Hans Christian Wulf, Bispebjerg University Hospital, Denmark.
The objective of the tour was to improve awareness in the general population of potential health consequences of sun exposure (actinic keratosis (AK) and skin cancer), and to educate on preventive measures linked to skin type as well as to improve current clinical knowledge of skin type and impact of UV radiation.
On the bus, visitors could fill out a questionnaire on previous sun exposure, sunburn, AK, skin cancers, etc., as well as receive an assessment of their skin type and a UV photo depicting sun damage in underlying skin.
Awareness of AK and skin cancer is currently limited to dermatologists and general practitioners, and patients are mostly unaware of impact and symptoms – and therefore also the notion of self-checking and importance of early diagnosis.
The lack of awareness is critical given the continuously growing prevalence of AK, and the growing consensus about perceiving AK as a precursor and an early stage of squamous cell carcinoma.
Questionnaires and skin type data have been linked to each respondent’s PNR (CPR) number, facilitating future research through registry linkage to e.g. the Danish Cancer Registry, National Patient Registry, etc."	Grant category: Research Grants in open competition	Geography: Denmark	Skin cancer awareness bus
